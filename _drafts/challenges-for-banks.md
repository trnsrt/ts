# Key Challenges to Traditional Finance

On our last post, we introduced DeFi - Decentralized Finance, a solution that would potentially empower individuals against legacy financial systems.  

We also touched upon the shortcomings of traditional finance; excessively large, slow and bureaucratic as well as working in silos... We will look into those areas in detail later, but first, let's look at a couple of challenges that traditional finance faces today. 

### Finance today
While we transition from analog life to a digital one, Financial players have been among key winners. Financial services, after all, require limited physical effort and is a perfect fit for a digital setup. 

As for us, the consumers, we love the  perks of digitalization: No need to go to a bank anymore, just use my own phone to meet all financial needs. 

Financial players? They loved this consumer demand:  No need to keep more tellers to serve us: While demand for financial services has grown exponentially, banks were able to meet this demand with limited additional resources, thanks to digital tools. Result: Skyrocketed fees, profits and market capitalizations for almost any financial player. 

Well, life comes in cycles and nothing lasts forever. Such profits attracted outside attention pretty quickly: "They have all the fancy offices yet they fail to provide basic services properly" says the consumer. "They have all that financial muscle, yet they are reluctant to allocate enough resources to meet our regulatory requirements" says the government.  

Here is the catch: Customers and government authorities, *now* have the power to act rather than simply complain. How? Let's have a closer look what they have inside their arsenal.

### Key challenges for financial players
Nowadays, financial actors are feeling the cold breath of three main external parties (if they are not, then I am sorry for their ignorance, they will be hit even harder in the future). 

Those are mainly: Individuals (i.e., their customers), governments (i.e. central banks), and tech giants (i.e. Facebooks and PayPals of the digital world). 

What is the common theme here? All three will use the power of technology to challenge banks and other financial institutions. How? Let's have a deeper dive on each one: 

#### Individuals (or public)
Why to individuals need financial institutions? Two key needs: Financial and transactional. 

First, humans accumulate wealth, through either working hard or inheritance. They need a safe place to store this wealth and prefer to have some additional benefit such as interest. Banks provide the most optimal solution for such needs. 

On the other side, some others need financing for immediate needs or longer term investments. Who would provide that better than banks? 

In short, banks are ideal places to store value and provide this value to those in need. 

Second, people get into arrangements with each other, to buy and sell 'things' and transfer a financial value in exchange. How do they do that? Using the comfort and trust provided by banks and other financial institutions. 

Sure, but all these benefits that banks provide, come with some cost and certain restrictions (which we discussed on our previous post). 

What if people were given an alternative option? Such as, a secure and cheaper value storage with full control? In other words, store your wealth at almost no cost and transfer it to anybody around the world, at any time you want, with no strings attached?

After being around for ten years, cryptocurrencies have reached the maturity to be a solid candidate to store and transfer wealth. Now, slowly and surely they are also attacking other parts of financial services, such as lending, borrowing, insurance, exchanges and so on.. That is what DeFi is for and we will continue to explore this area on our future posts. 

#### Governments (or central banks)
Governments have the control of monetary policy through central banks. Central banks deal with banks and other financial institutions to meet their monetary demand. Mass public have limited interaction with central banks. Instead, banks act as and intermediary between the government and general public. 

Do governments need direct access to individuals? Do they need that? Let's think about it for a second:

The other economic tool that governments have on hand is fiscal policy. In an overly simplified manner, this is how governments spend money to bring services to people and incentivize the economy. 

What if we combine monetary and fiscal policies under one roof such as central banks? In this case, the governments will have the chance to create much more effective policies:

By creating a bank account for each and every citizen, central banks will have direct access to every individual. Example> Let's say you want to give some incentive apple growers. Rather than using intermediaries like banks, you can directly put money into the accounts of those registered as apple farmers. Furthermore you can track and even control how they use this incentive (such as permitting them to use it only for fertilizers). 

Is this even feasible? Well, with a Central Bank Digital Currency, this is certainly possible. There are many more benefits for governments and several drawbacks for individuals but let's leave that for another post.

#### Tech giants (or Facebook or PayPals of the digital world)
Facebook has already announced that they will create a digital currency. Initially called Libra now changed to Diem, it will be a stable currency (meaning pegged to a fiat currency such as dollar or euro). This digital currency will be used to accommodate all the financial transactions in Facebook world (in addition to many other partners in the network).

PayPal has already accepted cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Their announcement of a native digital currency will not surprise anyone. The question is not if, more like when. Amazon has already started exploring digital currency in Mexico, so it is just a matter of time before they introduce it to North American market following by rest of the world. 

Why is this important for banks? These tech giants hold the end customer under their hands (via their apps). Customers are already tied to them for buying and selling side of a transaction. Now they will hold their grips on the financial side of that exchange as well. 

They will not let banks touch to their customer. If you do not touch your end user, then the game is over for you - you are out. 

### Next...
These are three major challengers for banks. Sure, but what do banks do to tackle these issues? Let's have a look at them on our next post.

# How do banks react to their challenges?
In our previous post, we discussed three major threats that banks feel behind their necks.  All these challenges have the potential to eliminate the need for banks acting as an intermediary between parties. 

Do banks just sit idle? Of course not. Let's have a closer look on what they do and what the future looks like for them 

### What do banks do?
Banks are well aware of their own shortcomings and have been looking for potential solutions  for a long time. However there are certain internal structural challenges they need to tackle:

First of all, banks developed their own systems during 70's or 80's (or even 90's in some emerging markets). These legacy systems are clearly outdated and it is painstakingly slow to migrate into newer technologies. In order to address changing customer needs quickly without changing their inters systems, they turned to startups for help. So a new sector was born: FinTech. 

Banks have heavily invested FinTech: They made partnerships with several startups, use their services as part of their core offerings. In some cases they bought these startups and brought their team in-house. Jury is still out on the effectiveness of such strategies:

On the one hand these startups brought a fresh air to the plazas that banks reside in. On the other hand, inevitably there have been cultural clashes between new kids on the block and the old guard. Who is the winner? In most (almost all cases), the old guard. Resulting in startup employees leaving the financial institutions to pursue other opportunities in outside world. 

However, there is a deeper issue here: Fintech will help banks adapt to new technologies, but not change how they structurally do things. 

### The market is changing and banks are losing their touch with their customers
In our last post, we mentioned three main threats to banks as individuals, central banks and tech giants. 

Thanks to emerging technologies, all three have the power to challenge banks. Individuals, through the use of decentralized solutions such as cryptocurrencies and DeFi. Centrals banks by issuing Central Banks Digital Currencies (CBDC's). Lastly, tech giants, already having been inside the pockets of customers through mobile phones and now using digital currencies to cut the cord between the bank and customer. 

Pattern is clear here. Banks are moving away from their customers. Their core function as the middleman between transactions is no longer needed. Individuals can use currencies or tech giants for their financial activities and central banks can directly interact with their citizens. 

### So what is next for banks?
Is it all doom and gloom for banks? Not necessarily. Here is a hypothesis that will be tested over the next decade:

While banks keep hold of most of their customer base, they may lose the lion's share. Customers may prefer the comfort of using other apps on their phones for their financial needs. Besides, these alternatives will be much cheaper. Why? Well, apps do not employ thousands of people, and do not occupy skyscrapers, so they are coming from a much lower cost base. 

The alternatives, like Facebook/PayPal or DeFi, may still need banks for certain transactions. As a result, they will make wholesale agreements with banks, to leverage banks' regulatory status and operational power. 

In essence, **banks will become the subcontractor for others. This will result in growing transaction volumes but with much lower margins**. 

Banks in turn will desperately try to slash their costs. Send most employees to their homes (a trend already gained popularity thanks to pandemic) and heavily use technology to replace human power.  No more offices in high rise buildings, expensive dinners, retreats in resorts or company drivers. All will be gone. 

### Conclusion
Banks will continue to be a major part of our financial activity. However, gone are the days where they have exponential growth with high margins. Cost improvement will be the name of the game: 

Smaller players will either transform into full online players or be acquired by others. Larger players will see their revenues grow however have hard time keeping sustainable profitability.  

Just like the internet has transformed the media, this new revolution will have a transformative effect on banks. Are you ready?
