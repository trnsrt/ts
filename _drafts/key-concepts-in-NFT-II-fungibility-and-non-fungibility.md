In our series on key NFT concepts, we started with digital ownership in our first post. We continue our series with non-fungibility concept. 

In order to understand what a 'non-fungible token is' perhaps it might make sense to look at fungible token first.

Fungibility is one of the key attributes of money. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) 'fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable and each of whose parts is indistinguishable from another part'. 

In short, if you give me 10 US dollars that you have in your pocket and I gave you the 10 dollars that I have in my wallet, we are even. Nothing changes. That 10 dollars in your pocket and my 10 dollars in my wallet are exactly the same. 

There are several caveats to the paragraph above. One of these notes might be fake and that is a whole different story. Another issue is those two banknotes seems same but they are not as each one has a unique serial number. A better example would be a gold coin certified by an expert. 10 grams of a gold var would be exactly the same of another 10 grams gold var. Back to our original story:

In crypto world, fungibility is key for cryptocurrencies. Each and every coin or token should be replaced with another one - this is important as that coin or token to be freely used and exchanged between people. This is how you utilize the 'medium of exchange' function of the money. 

Non-fungibility is the polar opposite of this. It means each and every token can be unique. We will have a look at that scarcity concept in our next post.
