- Amaçları ne böyle bir para çıkarmanın?
-- Bitcoin'in bir gün vulnerable olacağını düşünmeleri mi? Güvenlik açısından?
-- Şu an yeterince private olmadığı için insanları bir gün çekmeyeceğini düşündükleri için?
-- Şimdiden erken bir projede yer alıp "voliyi vurmak"?

- in terms of scaling?.
- bitcoin maximalists, interested
-- completely decentralized project (as opposed to ICO)
-- technology interesting

how the whitepaper came about?
- mysterious creater (like satoshi)
- came out of nowhere (harry potter character - posted a paper something on an IRC)
- mible-wimble a new blockchain
- another developer (harry potter character) said he is working on grin

solves two problems
- one is the kind of scaling side of the blocks, and the
- second appears to be privacy coming as default.
- to verify an output, you have to follow it all the way back to the beginning of a chain, basically, in order to verify it. This uses some mathematical tricks so that instead of having to verify the entire history of the chain, you can just verify instead that everything amounts to zero, so all the transactions and all the outputs and everything that goes into it just have to equal zero and then you know, you can validate it from there. you know that’s fine, and there was no new money created there. The inputs equal the outputs
- Well, there are no addresses. So everything happens kind of on the wallet side. So, on a Mimblewimble blockchain, since there’s no concept of address, all you have is a UTX set that just has outputs in it. It’s basically outputs and outputs and outputs all the way down. The way a transaction works is you don’t kind of put an address in and send it off to the chain. You actually have to communicate with another wallet. So the two wallets will work together, use their private keys to build a valid transaction, and then afterwards that transaction can get sent to the chain. So there’s certain, there are no addresses in a cryptographic sense.
- the solution for this wallet exchange, it’s not a one size fits all solution. Some people will be very, very concerned about, you know, everything is extremely private, and want to kind of set up their own communication network to make sure that everything they do is extremely private. Other people might be happy enough using an intermediary service that actually does the matchups and the transaction building. So what we’re trying to do on Grin is just make sure that we can enable all of those possibilities.

*A lot of flexibility for performing a transaction, you have to find a transacting party then match and then result to be written in blockchain- so it is always an output and it is always a zero-sum game, so you do not need to validate the whole history*
a lot more flexibility then? This could be done over email, private chat groups. It can be done almost with anything? 
- Yes. We have somebody now working on sending exchanges over Keybase, which I think is a nice little solution there because you already have the communication going there. You have filed in place, you have the people building mobile wallets, it should be possible to go and bump your phones together to do the transaction. So there’s, there’s a lot of possibilities there, definitely.

*bitcoin maximalists love it. especially grin. just like bitcoin, no founder, all key developers are hidden. is it something developed by crypto anarchists, as a backup to bitcoin, in case bitcoin to become influenced by a government or a centralized power in that sense?*
