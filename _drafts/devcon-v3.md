Recent news have created a wave of excitement in Turkish crypto ecosystem. [ALTERNATIVELY: An announcement circled around in recent weeks has galvanized the Turkish crypto ecosystem]. Main actors in the system, from thought leaders to students clubs sent tweets and changed their handles to support the case [ALT: issue]. The center of this excitement was a call to to organize the next Devcon in Istanbul.  Later on, a small group of leading figures in the communtiy established an informal committee and started thinking/acting on how to organize potentially the most effective crypto event in Turkish history. Such efforts, beyond impressing Devcon organizers, is a valuable sign to show how the ecosystem has developed recently, what improvements are required going forward.

Before we dive in, here is a brief context: 

[Devcon](https://devcon.org/), the main event for Ethereum developers and researchers is having its sixth gathering in Bogota this October. While attendees are putting their final touches on their itineraries for this exciting trip to Latin America, the organizers have already started thinking about the destination for the next event. [A recent survey](https://forum.devcon.org/c/devcon-7-location-suggestions/14) on the Devcon forum received seven suggestions so far. A couple of young Turks [proposed](https://forum.devcon.org/t/proposed-location-istanbul-turkiye/412/28) Istanbul as a candidate and received huge support: The comments and views for the proposal doubles the next candidate. 

## Why Istanbul? 

The answer to that question lies in the potential and perception of the Turkish community and crypto market. 

Crypto adoption in Turkey is not a secret - a recent [market research suggests](https://www.coindeskturkiye.com/sirketler/turkiye-kripto-piyasasinin-mercek-altina-alindigi-arastirmaya-gore-kripto-parayla-islem-yapanlarin-orani-yuzde-74-artti-1342) 8 million Turks are holding crypto assets. In that sense, Turkey is no different than any other emerging market: High inflation (80% YoY) and devaluation of local currency Turkish Lira (126% YoY against USD) are among key reasons why Turks are seeking for alternative investments. While foreign currencies and gold have historically been prominent tools to hedge against inflation, cryptocurrencies have emerged as popular alternative, which led IMF coined the term 'cryptoization' in their last October [Global Stability Report](https://blogs.imf.org/2021/10/01/crypto-boom-poses-new-challenges-to-financial-stability/).

Trading/investing in crypto is one form of crypto interest, but still, having such an enthusiasm for a development conference like Devcon is quite different and may come as a surprise to many.  Sure, event organizers listed several criteria for a potential host, of which Turkey in general and Istanbul in particular easily meet: Easy access (almost 600 [direct flights](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-to-istanbul-ist) from 117 countries to Istanbul daily, with either no visa required or available at the entrance [for most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Turkey#Visa_policy_map) visitors), proximity to Europe and Asia, safe and affordable neighborhoods with lots of attractive venues (just ask a friend who has been to Istanbul recently and they will definitely agree). These are all valid points but there has to be more than that for organizers to select a city. Is there an active community around and would organizing a conference here make a difference in that community? 

Developer community have always been relatively small compared to crypto asset holders but it is growing rapidly with university students taking the lead. The country has one of the youngest populations in the world - (almost [half of the population](https://datacommons.org/place/country/TUR?category=Demographics#Population-by-age) is younger than 30) of which [8.4 million](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/turkey-education) are enrolled in higher education. How about crypto interest? In our latest count, there were [41 university blockchain clubs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kE0IZyaQbAXxTGGugGixiC0VRhoLIRKusCq1twtW3GI/edit#gid=0) with hundreds of members (leading one [ITU Blockchain](https://www.itublockchain.com/) has roughly about 2500 volunteers alone).  When I was appointed as an advisor to [BlockchainIST](https://blockchainist.org/), the first university blockchain research center in Istanbul a couple of years ago, this number was less than 10. How come such a dramatic increase then? I asked several blockchain clubs and they came back with similar response:

## The Appetite for Growth

First of all, there is a growing appetite among new generation to integrate into global markets. Digital opportunities such as blockchain projects are among key avenues to fulfill this dream. Despite such interest, however, Visa requirements and recent devaluation of Turkish Lira against all major currencies have effectively made it almost impossible for them to move out of the country, either for pleasure or work.

Despite such financial difficulties, students in groups have started to attend global events since restrictions due to pandemic were lifted. Following a local [hackathon](https://istanbul.avalanchehacks.com/) last December, more than ten students from three different university clubs joined [Avalanche Barcelona Summit](https://www.avalanchesummit.com/). Soon after, small groups managed to travel to [ETHAmsterdam](https://amsterdam.ethglobal.com/), [ETHPrague](https://ethprague.com/), [ETHBarcelona](https://ethbarcelona.com/), [ETHCC 5](https://ethcc.io/), [Eth Mexico City](https://soliditydeveloper.com/eth-mexico-city) and lastly [ETHBerlin](https://ethberlin.ooo/). A group of ten students are planning to attend Devcon Bogota as well.  Those were all made possible by scholarships granted by organizers, local businesses (such as [LykaDAO](https://www.laykadao.space/) and [Paribu](https://www.paribu.com/)) as well as global players (such as [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [Talent House](https://www.talenthouse.com.tr/)). 

Several local initiatives have sparked the interest in community as well. First, couple of hackathons, including [AvalancheHacks](https://istanbul.avalanchehacks.com/), [NFT and Metaverse Hackhaton](https://hackathonturkiye.com/etkinlik/blokzincir-nft-ve-metaverse-hackathonu) and [Blockcircus](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchain-egitim-hackathon-blockcircus-tickets-46836838244). Several and student club organizations [Blockchain and Beyond Summit](https://sites.google.com/view/blockchain-beyondsummit/ana-sayfa) and [Blockchain Networking Day](https://twitter.com/bogazicichain/status/1525200754792857601) attracted significant crowds. Then, several corporate events namely [Blockchain Economy Summit](https://blockchaineconomy.istanbul/en), [NFT Summit](https://nftsummit.ist/), [Eurasia Blockchain Summit](https://www.eurasiablockchain.com/), [Kriptofest](https://kriptofest.org/), [Istanbul Blockchain Week](https://istanbulblockchainweek.com/) all raised the awareness in corporate world (though the quality of such events varies significantly). On top of that recent gatherings such as [Cyptist](https://www.cryptist.org/) and [Mina Developer Meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mina-zkapp-developers-meetup-istanbul-tickets-344946232467) also attracted interest from the developer community. The momentum continues with weekly CryptoMondays events, recently launched Web3 hub [Lunapark](https://lunapark.social/) and several people aiming to organize an ETH Istanbul in the near future. 

## Boosting the Potential

[Kaan](https://twitter.com/kaanuzdogan), one of the employees of Ethereum Foundation had a similar experience. He became interested in the area only after he took a blockchain class while having his undergrad at Bogazici University. Most of his friends chose AI/ML back then. Had there been a blockchain club around or events organized at the time, many more of his friends would have opted for blockchain projects.

One more point to add: Let's not forget that the developer ecosystem here is not confined to Turks. Recent unfortunate events in Ukraine resulted in a flood of developers from Ukraine and Russia into Istanbul and coastal regions of Turkey. A friend of mine alone helped three businesses with close to two hundred software engineers to relocate here. This fresh influx of talent will have positive impact on the growth of the developer community in the region. 

In short: A young population with strong potential but with limited access to global community. A handful of them get scholarship and attend global events (and win prizes). This creates a buzz in local environment. Local events raise the awareness among businesses and also help bringing in new talent.  On top of that, a recent fresh talent inflow from outside to an already vibrant local market. 

Now, let's imagine: If sending couple of students to global events create such an outcome, what would be the effect of bringing all the developers from all around the globe to Istanbul?
