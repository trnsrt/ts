My last post was about digital identities. In summary: Tech giants are getting more and more powerful everyday posing a thread to privacy and in essence to freedom. Solution: Give power back to individuals. How? A decentralized model, where the users fully own and control their digital identity. 

The question is: Is it possible to apply the same logic to other parts of our digital lives?

## Introducing DeFi

This is actually what DeFi (decentralized finance) has been trying to bring to the table. As the main use case of blockchain technologies in financial sector, DeFi focuses on giving the power back to individuals. 

Why do we need blockchain technologies in finance? Let's have a closer look:

## How has financial players fared along so far?

Finance as we know it now is a legacy from old times. By old times I mean mainly from 20th century. 

While transitioning to digital world, legacy financial systems were the real winners. Why? First of all, economic activity has boomed thanks to digital economy. This, by itself is a source of major growth but even more to the story: A financial intermediary, in essence,  brings 'trust' to relations between parties, an essential piece in financial transactions. With digital economy where parties do not necessarily know or even see each other, the need for trust has grown even bigger. As a result, financial institutions have enjoyed a much higher growth in revenues, profits and market capitalization. 

All great - as long as you adopt to digital life and customers needs. This is where financial institutions failed to meet these expectations. 

## What is the problem here?

As life becomes extremely fast in digital world, these institutions stuck in 20th century, with slow archaic technology. They became so big that they are swamped with their own bureaucracy. They kept operating in silos, not a bank's system speaking to another. Regulations did not help either: Bank activities are limited to 9am to 5pm with no weekends. They are only allowed to accept 'eligible' individuals as customers - which resulted in exclusion of 1.7 people globally according to World Bank.. 

## How does DeFi address these problems?

DeFi as a philosophy aims to give the financial power to individuals. How do they do that? Couple of key principles to highlight are as follows:

Non-custodial: Financial institutions as a general rule holds the custody of their customers. This is actually the main reason behind many of their problems they face today. Why? Holding someone else's money brings a significant amount of responsibility. This brings a lot of legal scrutiny and financial regulations. 

DeFi platforms, on the contrary do not hold any of their customers' assets. They are merely financial tools, nothing more. Customers hold keys to their digital assets. They use their assets i) in any platform, ii)) at any time and iii) as long as they would like. They may leave as soon as they are done and never need to look back. 

This brings both power and responsibility to the individual. Power, as the individual is the sole custodian of their asset and responsibility as there is no third party to hold accountable but the individual's own self. 

Composable: As part of DeFi philosophy, all platforms in the space work with each other. All the customer needs is an electronic wallet to keep assets. Connecting that wallet is all it takes to start using the DeFi platform.  That is it. 

As there is a certain standard among platforms, it is possible to add platforms on top of each other and create different products - or "building money legos"  as they call it in DeFi)

Inclusive: Any one can access to DeFi platforms. The only prerequisite is an internet connection. Any eligibility criteria used by legacy institutions is totally irrelevant in this world. A novel approach to bring 'banking the unbankable' buzzword into life.

Open source : Another key element of DeFi is openness. All the source codes in DeFi platform is open. This brings a significant amount of transparency. Rather than trusting the institutions and their employees that they act honestly, all that is required is to review the code (or "trust the code" as they say in DeFi). 

Let's finish with what we said in previous post: All is possible, thanks to technology but mainly to blockchain and crypto. This is coming. Sooner that you would imagine...
